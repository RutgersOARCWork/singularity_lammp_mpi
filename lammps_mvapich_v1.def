## Definition file for Singularity v3.6
## Tell the Singularity bootstrap agent to pull CentOS 7 from the
## Container Library.
BootStrap: yum
OSVersion: 7
MirrorURL: http://mirror.centos.org/centos-%{OSVERSION}/%{OSVERSION}/os/$basearch/
Include: yum

## Setup a response in case someone queries "help" for this container
%help
Please contact Paul Arias for help: pgarias@oarc.rutgers.edu

## Commands executed on the host system outside of the container after
## the base OS has been installed. Need to copy the modified Makefile.mpi
## because the default version of gcc used with the mvapich2 installation
## requires --std=c++11 flag to be added to Makefile.mpi. See LAMMPS
## installation instructions for more details
%files 
  Makefile.mpi /opt

%setup
  cd $SINGULARITY_ROOTFS/opt
  wget http://lammps.sandia.gov/tars/lammps-stable.tar.gz

## Here is where you can download files from the internet with tools
## like git and wget, install new software and libraries, write
## configuration files, create new directories, etc.
